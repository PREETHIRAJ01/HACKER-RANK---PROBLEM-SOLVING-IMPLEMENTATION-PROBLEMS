proceeding:
A. check if all constraints are met
- these constraints are listed at the bottom of the exercise
- if any of the constraints are broken , get new data.
- you can define a function to check the constrains.

B. define the candidates for 'X'
- note that the candidates for 'x' can only fall between the
smallest and the largest values of both sets of data.

if A={2,4} and B={8,16,32}
the candidates of 'x' from these sets are between 2 and 32
hence range[2 - 32] defines all possible candidates.

C. counting your successful candidates x.
- after you have the range you should loop through it
examining if the candidate meets the predefined requirements
1. candidate % ai == 0; and
2. bi % candidate == 0;

if the candidate passed both tests, you can store or count it.
