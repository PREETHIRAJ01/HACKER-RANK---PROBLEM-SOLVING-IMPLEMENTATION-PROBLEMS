Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find the GCD of those 2 numbers.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers A and B.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the GCD of the two numbers.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= A, B <= 103

Example:
Input:
98 56
48 18

Output:
14
6

code:
HCF OF GIVEN NUMBERS IS ALWAYS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE SMALLEST NUMBER
SO I AM CHECKING THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF A AND B 
STARTING I FROM THE SMALLEST NUMBER, THE HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR WHICH DIVIDES BOTH THE NUMBER IS THE ANSWER.
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int t;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	int a,b,hcf,n,i;
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
	    n=a<b?a:b;
	    for(i=n;i>=1;i--)
	    {
	        if(a%i==0 && b%i==0)
	        {
	            hcf=i;
	            break;
	        }
	    }
	    printf("%d\n",hcf);
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
